# Test Document with Multiple Paragraphs

This is the first paragraph. It contains some content that should be included in the first chunk when the chunk size is large enough.

This is the second paragraph. It should be combined with the first paragraph if the chunk size allows it.

This is the third paragraph. It should also be combined if there's enough space in the chunk.

This is the fourth paragraph. It might be in a separate chunk if the previous paragraphs already filled up the chunk size.

This is the fifth paragraph. It continues the content and should be properly chunked based on the available space.
