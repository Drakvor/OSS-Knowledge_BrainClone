# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from data. These systems improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

There are three main types of machine learning approaches. Each has its own strengths and use cases.

### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs. The algorithm learns from examples where the correct answer is already known. Common applications include spam detection, image classification, and price prediction.

### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or structures. The algorithm explores the data without predefined categories. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are popular unsupervised techniques.

### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning trains agents to make decisions through trial and error. The agent receives rewards or penalties based on its actions. This approach is used in robotics, game playing, and autonomous systems.

## Key Concepts

Understanding machine learning requires familiarity with several fundamental concepts. These building blocks form the foundation of modern AI systems.

### Training and Testing

Models are trained on historical data and tested on new, unseen data. The training phase involves adjusting model parameters to minimize errors. Testing evaluates how well the model generalizes to new situations.

### Overfitting and Underfitting

Overfitting occurs when a model learns training data too well, including noise. Underfitting happens when a model is too simple to capture patterns. Finding the right balance is crucial for model performance.

## Conclusion

Machine learning continues to evolve and transform industries worldwide. From healthcare to finance, its applications are expanding rapidly. Understanding these fundamentals is essential for anyone entering the field.
